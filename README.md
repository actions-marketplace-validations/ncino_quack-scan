# Description

Run static code dependency scan using Black Duck Synopsys scan for NPM and PIP using Synopsys 6.0. For details on properties and the Black Duck Synopsis scan refer to their documentation here: https://blackducksoftware.github.io/synopsys-detect/6.0.0/. Inputs prefaced with bd are referring to arguments in the Black Duck scan. Descriptions are shared from the current documentation published.'

# Example Local Actions

Example local actions are kept in the example-local-actions directory. To use quack-scan checkout the project repository, run project setup, and install the java jdk before executing the scan.

# Inputs

- bd_url:

  - description: 'URL of the Black Duck server.'
  - required: true

- bd_api_token:

  - description: 'The API token used to authenticate with the Black Duck Server.'
  - required: true

- detect_project_name:

  - description: 'An override for the name to use for the Black Duck project.
    If not supplied, Detect will attempt to use the tools to figure
    out a reasonable project name. If that fails, the final part of
    the directory path where the inspection is taking place will be used.'
  - required: false
  - default: '${{ github.event.repository.name }}'

- detect_project_version_name:

  - description: 'An override for the version to use for the Black Duck project.
    If not supplied, Detect will attempt to use the tools to figure
    out a reasonable version name. If that fails, the current date
    will be used.'
  - required: false
  - default: '${GITHUB_REF##\*/}'

- detect_required_detector_types:

  - description: 'The set of required detectors. If you want one or more detectors
    to be required (must be found to apply), use this property to
    specify the set of required detectors. If this property is set,
    and one (or more) of the given detectors is not found to apply,
    Detect will fail.'
  - required: false
  - default: 'NPM'

- detect_included_detector_types:

  - description: 'By default, all tools will be included. If you want to include
    only specific tools, specify the ones to include here. Exclusion
    rules always win. If you want to limit Detect to a subset of its
    detectors, use this property to specify that subset.'
  - required: false
  - default: 'NPM,PIP'

- detect_tools:

  - description: 'The tools Detect should allow in a comma-separated list. Tools
    in this list (as long as they are not also in the excluded list)
    will be allowed to run if all criteria of the tool are met.
    Exclusion rules always win. This property and detect.tools.excluded
    provide control over which tools Detect runs.'
  - required: false
  - default: 'DETECTOR'

- detect_detector_search_depth:

  - description: 'Depth of subdirectories within the source directory to which
    Detect will search for files that indicate whether a detector
    applies. A value of 0 (the default) tells Detect not to search
    any subdirectories, a value of 1 tells Detect to search first-level
    subdirectories, etc.'
  - required: false
  - default: '15'

- detect_npm_include_dev_dependencies:
  description: 'Set this value to false if you would like to exclude your dev
  dependencies when ran.'

  - required: false
  - default: 'false'

- detect_detector_search_exclusion_paths:

  - description: 'A comma-separated list of directory paths to exclude from detector
    search. (E.g. foo/bar/biz will only exclude the biz directory
    if the parent directory structure is foo/bar/.) This property
    performs the same basic function as detect.detector.search.exclusion,
    but lets you be more specific.'
  - required: false
  - default: ''

- detect_detector_search_exclusion_defaults:

  - description: 'If true, the bom tool search will exclude the default directory names.
    See the detailed help for more information. If true, these directories
    will be excluded from the detector search: bin, build, .git, .gradle,
    node_modules, out, packages, target.'
  - required: false
  - default: 'true'

- detect_detector_search_exclusion_patterns:
  - description: 'A comma-separated list of directory name patterns to exclude from
    detector search. While searching the source directory to determine
    which detectors to run, subdirectories whose name match a pattern
    in this list will not be searched.'
  - required: false
  - default: ''

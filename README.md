  detect_project_name:
    description:    'An override for the name to use for the Black Duck project. 
                    If not supplied, Detect will attempt to use the tools to figure 
                    out a reasonable project name. If that fails, the final part of 
                    the directory path where the inspection is taking place will be used.'

    description:    'An override for the version to use for the Black Duck project. 
                    If not supplied, Detect will attempt to use the tools to figure

                    to be required (must be found to apply), use this property to

                    rules always win. If you want to limit Detect to a subset of its

                    Detect will search for files that indicate whether a detector 
                    applies. A value of 0 (the default) tells Detect not to search 
                    any subdirectories, a value of 1 tells Detect to search first-level
